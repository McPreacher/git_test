	<h1>Saying hello to a world that doesn't say hello back</h1>
	
	<p>What can we do when we say hello world and the world doesn't 
	answer back?  Just keep saying hello world!  In whatever language
	you are learning, whether it's ruby, python, or C, tell the world
	hello as enthusiastically as possible.  Never give up!  Here are 
	some programming languages with which you can learn to say "hello 
	world":
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Fortran</li>
		<li>C(C#, C++)</li>
		<li>Lisp(probably hates the world, though)</li>
		<li>Perl</li>
	</ul>
